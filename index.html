			Some things about <a href="www.nodq.com">NO DQ</a>, a different wrestling website.
		</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The website is extremely text heavy - the homepage content is almost entirely links</li>
				<li>Only using a very small amount of space on the homepage, looks more like a tumblr layout than website</li>
				<li>Navigation links are very clear and accessible</li>
				<li>Ads seem much more apparent because the content is crammed into a small space</li>
			</ol>
		<p>	
			By viewing source, I see mostly HTML that I recognize, as the site is heavily stylized with CSS. One HTML element that I recognize yet is the <link> rel attribute, which I know is used to specify the relationship between the current document and a linked document. You can use this attribute to link to a CSS Stylesheet, for instance. Or to link to an author of the content.
